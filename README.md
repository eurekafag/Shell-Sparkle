## What? ##
Yeah, this is a Dropbox clone written on POSIX shell and bunch of standart utils one may expect being installed on an average machine. It offers versioned storage, USB drive autosynchronizing via udev, some desktop integration (at least Thunar, Nautilus and Dolphin should be supported) and simple CLI interface for the best of us. Or should it be "rest"?

Well, there's no help included, yet. You may dig into the code and learn how to use this by yourself. This is almost untested so use at your own risk.
